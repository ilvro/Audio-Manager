# Audio-Manager
Audio Manager is a tool used to quickly control audio. You can add your own songs and it's not restricted to audio that is only on Spotify.

You might find it very useful to DM D&D sessions - it was designed for that. You can play music, sound effects, or any mp3/mp4 file, and it's easy to use.
